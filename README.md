# Research Scientist Interview Guide

> “Think mathematically, reason scientifically, and build efficiently.”  
> — A Comprehensive 2025 Research Scientist Preparation Curriculum

---

## Purpose

This guide is a **structured, story-driven roadmap** for preparing for **Research Scientist roles** in any organizations.  
It is designed to help you:
- Build deep theoretical intuition,  
- Practice coding from first principles, and  
- Develop research reasoning aligned with academic and industrial labs.

The guide balances **mathematical theory**, **statistical rigor**, and **hands-on coding**, while tracing the **evolution of algorithms** — from classical ML to modern Deep Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models.

---

## Learning Philosophy

Every algorithm evolved to solve a *pain point* in its predecessor.  
This guide follows that lineage:

> **Linear Models → Nonlinear Trees → Ensemble Boosting → Neural Networks → Transformers → LLMs → DRL → Physics-Informed & Federated Systems**

Each topic answers **“why the next method was needed”**, with theory, math, implementation, and interview reasoning.

## Learning Strategy

1. **Start from Intuition:** Understand *why* each model exists.  
2. **Mathematical Insight:** Derive equations manually — gradients, losses, activations.  
3. **Implementation:** Rebuild models from scratch in PyTorch (no `sklearn` black boxes).  
4. **Visualization:** Use `matplotlib` / `seaborn` / `plotly` for loss landscapes and weight evolution.  
5. **Analysis:** Compare bias, variance, and stability across algorithms.  
6. **Communication:** Summarize insights as if presenting to a research committee.
