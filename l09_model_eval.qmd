# Model Evaluation and Analysis
This chapter provides a unified framework for evaluating and analyzing models across multiple AI paradigms: `Machine Learning (ML)`, `Deep Learning (DL)`, `Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)`, `Large Language Models (LLMs)`, and `Computer Vision (CV)`.
The goal is to assess performance, robustness, efficiency, and interpretability, providing actionable insights for model improvement and real-world deployment.

## ML Model Evaluation & Analysis
> Applies to classical models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, and Gradient Boosting for structured data.

The Evaluation Metrics are :

### Calculate Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Analysis

- Use cross-validation for unbiased performance estimation.
- Visualize confusion matrix and feature importances.
- Evaluate bias–variance tradeoff with learning curves.
- Assess scalability for increasing dataset sizes.

Interpretation:
- Consistent performance across folds with stable feature importance indicates generalizatio
